## About Project

This project is built as a practice for optimizing search queries in a populated database. We start with a regular database, then fill it with data to slow down the query times, and then use optimization techniques to achieve faster query calls compared to the unoptimized ones. Using this project, you can replicate the database to see how you can also implement your own solutions to the problems, or see how your solution compares to ours.

The following are screenshot displaying the before and after results on analysing the SQL data.
